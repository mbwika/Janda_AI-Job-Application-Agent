# Ignore all JSON files
*.json

# If you have specific JSON files you want to keep, you can whitelist them like this:
#!important-config.json
git rm --cached *.json
# This will remove all JSON files from the index, but keep them in your working directory.
# If you want to ignore all JSON files except for a specific one, you can do:
# Ignore all JSON files except for important-config.json
# !important-config.json
